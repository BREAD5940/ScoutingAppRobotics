Scouting app changes:

UI:
	- option of 'didn't get off the hab'
	- option for 'didn't get back on the hab'
	- option for splines/no splines
	- option for vision system
	- option for starting piece
	- match number
	- match type (practice, quals, etc.)
	- floor intake in match
	- option for 'it kinda stopped for a while but then it was fine'
	- option for elevator levels in match
	- maybe a subjective 'rating'
	- maybe information pannels (ex. click on 'i' and it tells you what a tech foul is/what it looks like)
	- typo checking (ex. team number doesn't exist)

BACKEND:
	-  n a m i n g
	- some sort of table joining to better store data
		- ex a unified table for each team, sorted into mech/design data and indiv match data
			- we'd need match num input for this
			- maybe mech/design should overwrite?
				- how would that impact notes?
			- maybe do all this on the main filesystem?
		- this might already be kinda a thing, I haven't looked at the raw csvs
	- tba tie-in
	- nfc for better file transfer
	
DONE:
	- option for encoders
	- no more placing negative pieces
	- notes box bigger
